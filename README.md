# About tnf11nt.co

This repository contains version 6 of my personal website, [tnflnt.co](https://tnflnt.co). This time around, we're using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to generate the static site and running the whole thing on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Credits

This project was generated from the [eleventy-netlify-boilerplate](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate) by Dan Urbanowicz, a delightfully straightforward one-click deployed project for learning Eleventy. 

More to come.
